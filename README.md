# My-Portfolio

# Description

My goal was to create a portfolio where I can share a save my work I create in class and i can share eventually in the future. I made three sections on the page, About myself, work, and contact information for employers too see and in the future and have a way to get in touch. I learned how to use CSS to style the page and layout
